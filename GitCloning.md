# git cloning

Cloning is recommended, as it's easier to update, but in the case of windows, this will need git tools to be installed (other operating systems may have it already installed)

My personal recommendation is to install tortoiseGit (https://tortoisegit.org/), but other alternatives are available - for tortoiseGit you should be able to install it with the preselected options

There are "how-to's" available for tortoiseGit - one being https://learn.adafruit.com/an-introduction-to-collaborating-with-version-control/installing-tortoisegit-on-windows

There's also guides available on how to clone a repository, such as https://learn.adafruit.com/an-introduction-to-collaborating-with-version-control/working-with-existing-repositories
and
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository
